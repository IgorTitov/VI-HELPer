# VI-HELPer
LabVIEW plugin for creating better VI documentation (help files)

Help Editor for LabVIEW Programs (HELPer) is a VI documentation tool that allows the developer to create or edit comprehensive and thorough VI documentation (like those in the 'Detailed VI Help') and some other types of VI help documents in quick, easy and very intuitive way. Unlike built-in 'Print VI...' LabVIEW option, HELPer gives you means to create HTML help files in 'LabVIEW Help' style, with more control over generated document layout and some other enhanced features described in subsequent sections of this document. HELPer generates ready-to-use documents, so that the end user (LabVIEW developer) doesn't have to invest any time into learning HTML.
